# Typography workshop two

In the second of our typography workshops we will focus on using type to enhance the presentation of our content. From an existing design with minimal type treatment, we will slowly enhance the typography from basic CSS type properties to the new shiny like Open Type Features.

In the workshop we will cover the following:

- Broad overview of fonts on the web
- Choosing and pairing fonts
- Units of measure
- Setting a typograhic scale
- Basic CSS type properties: color, sizing, line-height, etc
- Advanced CSS type properties: Open Type Features

As an attendee you should have some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (or be willing to learn). If you have a laptop, bring it with you.

We will announce the sign up procedure shortly.
