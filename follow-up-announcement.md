Hello CTFEDs member!

RSVPs are now open for the second of our typography workshops on 10 December. As there are only 20 spaces available for this workshop we are doing special RSVPs. When you RSVP you’ll be added to the waiting list and we’ll contact you via meetup, asking for confirmation of your attendance.

Details of the workshop are here: https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/235901778/

We hope to see you there!

Regards,

Danielle & Justin & Steve
